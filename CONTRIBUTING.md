All work is done on our [Gitlab](https://git.octree.ch/p/caroster) and mirrored to Github.

There is many way you can contribute to Caroster, as Caroster is a volunteer effort:

#### **Test Caroster**
Testing the functionnalities are highly important for us. To test the last stable version, you can go on [caroster.io](https://caroster.io). 
If you want to test the last unstable version and have the skills to run a Caroster locally, you are also more than welcome.

To [open a new one](https://git.octree.ch/p/caroster/-/issues/new) please mind to share: 
- What did you do before the issue happens?
- With what device (browser, OS, mobile)?
- What did you expect? 
- What did happen ? 

Screenshots, URLs are also more than welcome. Code samples and executable test cases are the bests.

Please mind: 
1. **Do not open up an issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead to send an email to caroster@octree.ch.
2. **Ensure the issue was not already reported** by searching on GitLab under [Issues](https://git.octree.ch/p/caroster/-/issues).

#### **Contribute to bug fixes**

- Open a new GitLab merge request with the fix.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Add tests that demonstrate the fix.

### **Propose a change (RFC)**
To propose an architectural change of the code, a change of the contribution process, or any changes that is not related to a specific area of the code, open a RFC!
A Request For Comment is an issue that introduce a discussion you want to have with the community or the Caroster Team.

A Request For Comment need to have the following information: 
- Context: Why do you request comment at the first place?
- Proposal: What would you like to propose?
- Alternatives: What did you think as an alternative
- Expectation: Do you need a decision? Just an open discussion?

We do not expect RFC's author to stay accountable for the implementation of anything after posting a proposal.
We will though close a RFC if the author stays unresponsive for more than a month. 

### **Contribute to the documentation**
For now, we do not maintain documentation beyond the README.md. If you have suggestion, please open a RFC.
