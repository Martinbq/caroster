# Caroster - Group carpool to your event

Caroster is an easy and free app to organize group carpooling for an event, a party, a seminar, a sports event, a camp, a ski tripâ€¦

> Are you on GitHub ? Please use the [reference repository on GitLab](https://git.octree.ch/p/caroster) for issues and pull requests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Caroster is composed of two parts:

- A frontend app based on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- A backend server using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)

> Caroster is currently in Beta. Big changes can happen, especially in terms of data architecture.

### Prerequisites

To fully utilize your instance of Caroster, you will need an SMTP configuration to send emails.

### Installing

Clone the repo locally:

```shell
git clone https://git.octree.ch/p/caroster.git
cd caroster
```

### Run with Docker

First, edit `docker-compose.yml` to provide your SMTP configuration:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    ...
    SMTP_HOST: smtp.myserver.org
    SMTP_PORT: 587
    SMTP_USERNAME: user
    SMTP_PASSWORD: password
...
```

Then, create containers with Docker Compose:

```shell
docker compose up
```

Wait a few minutes while the application downloads needed packages,
then go to http://localhost:8080.

You can log on http://localhost:8080/admin with email `admin@example.org`
and password `caroster`.

## Development

### Frontend

These steps will prepare the frontend to run in development mode.

```shell
cd frontend
yarn # or 'npm install'
yarn dev
```

The frontend is now accessible on http://localhost:3000

### Backend

These steps will prepare and configure the backend to run in development mode.

> You need a Postgres database running locally. Start one with `docker compose up psql -d`.

```shell
cd backend
yarn # or 'npm install'
cp .env.example .env
vi .env # Edit with your own configuration
yarn develop
```

The Strapi server is now ready and the admin is accessible on http://localhost:1337/admin.

## Running the tests

A few tests are available to check GraphQL endpoints behavior in the `e2e` directory.

First, run Strapi in test mode:

```shell
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
vi .env # Edit with your own configuration
yarn start-test
```

Then, run the tests:

```shell
cd e2e
yarn
yarn gql
yarn test
```
